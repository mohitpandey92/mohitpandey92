## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a Machine Learning Scientist with over five years of experience in deep learning, optimization algorithms, and software engineering. I'm passionate about leveraging these skills to analyze high-throughput biological datasets. My background includes a Ph.D. in Computational Statistical Physics and Biophysics, along with biotech industry experience in i)  peptide and protein modeling, and ii) CRISPR-Cas gene-editing and epigenetic-editing medicine. I'm eager to collaborate on projects that use AI to accelerate drug discovery and improve patient outcomes

## 📂 My Selected Projects

- GNN-VAE: A custom-built graph neural network VAE (Generative AI) to generate peptide sequences with an alpha-helical constraint, which are predicted to have high cell permeability.
- Finetuned pLM: Finetuned protein language model on proprietary CRISPR-Cas gene editing data
- [data-science-template](https://github.com/mohitpandey92/pyproject-template): A Python package to create a quick template for starting a Data Science project
