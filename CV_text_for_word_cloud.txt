As a Machine Learning Scientist with more than five years of experience in deep learning, optimization algorithms, and software engineering, I am passionate about  my skills to analyze high-throughput biological datasets. I have a strong Ph.D. training in Computational Statistical Physics and Biophysics, and subsequent experience in industry working on i) peptide and protein modeling and ii) CRISPR-Cas gene-editing medicine. I am eager to collaborate with others to bring the power of AI to drug discovery and improve patient outcomes.
